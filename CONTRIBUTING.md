Welcome
-------

We invite you to join our team! Everyone is welcome to contribute code
via pull requests, to file issues on GitHub, to help people asking for
help on our mailing lists, our chat channels to
help triage, reproduce, or fix bugs that people have filed, to add to our
documentation, or to help out in any other way.

We grant commit access (which includes full rights to the issue
database, such as being able to edit labels) to people who have gained
our trust and demonstrated a commitment.

We communicate primarily over GitHub.

Helping out in the issue database
---------------------------------

If you want to help us triage, you are very welcome to do so!


1. Read [our code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which stipulates explicitly
   that everyone must be gracious, respectful, and professional. If you're helping out
   with triage, you are representing the Flutter team, and so you want to make sure to
   make a good impression!

2. Help us by raporting bugs. You can also help by trying to reproduce the problem and asking for people to
   provide enough details that you can reproduce the problem, pointing out duplicates,
   and so on.
